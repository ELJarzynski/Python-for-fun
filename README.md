# Python for Fun


## This repository contains a variety of Python algorithms and mini-games that I work on when I'm not feeling particularly inspired or when I just want to try out new ideas
### Terminal games
- **Dice Game**: A simple dice rolling game.
- **Monopoly-like Game**: A board game inspired by Monopoly, coded just for fun!

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or just play around with the games.
